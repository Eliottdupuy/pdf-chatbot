1. "src/original.css": This file contains the original CSS code that needs to be converted to Tailwind CSS. It shares the CSS selectors, properties, and values with the conversion script.

2. "src/converted_to_tailwind.css": This file will contain the converted Tailwind CSS code. It shares the Tailwind CSS classes with the conversion script.

3. "src/css_to_tailwind_converter.py": This is the Python script that will convert the original CSS to Tailwind CSS. It shares the CSS selectors, properties, values, and Tailwind CSS classes with the original and converted CSS files.

Shared Dependencies:

1. CSS Selectors: These are the names of the HTML elements, classes, and ids that are targeted by the CSS rules in the original CSS file. They are used by the conversion script to identify which elements to convert.

2. CSS Properties and Values: These are the styles applied to the CSS selectors in the original CSS file. They are used by the conversion script to determine the equivalent Tailwind CSS classes.

3. Tailwind CSS Classes: These are the utility classes provided by Tailwind CSS. They are used by the conversion script to replace the original CSS properties and values, and they are written to the converted CSS file.

4. Conversion Functions: These are the functions defined in the conversion script that perform the conversion from original CSS to Tailwind CSS. They use the CSS selectors, properties, values, and Tailwind CSS classes.

5. File Paths: The paths to the original and converted CSS files are shared between the conversion script and the CSS files. The script needs to know where to read the original CSS from and where to write the converted CSS to.
